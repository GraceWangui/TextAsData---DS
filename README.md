# Natural Language Processing: Text as Data

This repository documents my personal exploration and implementation of core concepts in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, with a focus on treating **text as data** for computational analysis. Goal - Work on real world datasets to do advanced NLP.

The project covers a range of fundamental and advanced topics in NLP, accompanied by code examples, experiments, and insights derived from hands-on work.

## üìù Topics Covered
 
**Tokenization**  
**Document Similarity**  
**Geometric Similarity**  
**Text Distributions**  
**Clustering**  
**Language Modelling**  
**Text Classification**  
**Contextual Word Embeddings**  
**Part-of-Speech Tagging and Parsing**  
**And many more **

## üí° About This Project

The goal of this project is to:

- Build a practical understanding of how to process and analyze natural language data.
- Implement common NLP techniques from scratch and using popular libraries.
- Experiment with real world data and different models and evaluation strategies for text analysis tasks.


Each topic is organized into its own notebook, with explanations, code snippets, comments and results.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python  
- NLTK  
- spaCy  
- scikit-learn  
- gensim  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (for embeddings and modelling)

## Why Text as Data?

Text is an abundant and rich source of information. By applying computational methods to text, we can uncover patterns, make predictions, and gain insights that are valuable across disciplines‚Äîfrom social science and marketing to healthcare and policy analysis.

This project is a testament to my interest in **bridging data science and language** through thoughtful and ethical NLP practices.
